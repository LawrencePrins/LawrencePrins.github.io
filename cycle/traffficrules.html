    <a href="#menu1">01_General rule of conduct <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p>Everyone is prohibited from behaving in such a way that danger is (or can be) caused on the road or that traffic on the road is (can be) hindered. This is a rule that can be interpreted broadly, so you just behave nicely in traffic is the wisest

<section id="menu2">
    <a href="#menu2">02_Article 185 (liability) <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p>If you collide with a car, you can appeal to article 185 of the Road Traffic Act. This article stipulates that the driver of a motor vehicle is partly responsible for the consequences of an accident with a pedestrian or cyclist, unless there was force majeure. Practice shows that it is difficult for motorists to make that force majeure hard. The driver is almost always responsible for at least fifty percent for the damage to cyclist and bicycle.</p>

<section id="menu3">
    <a href="#menu3">03_Requirements for your bike <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
<p class="textoranje">Permanent requirements</p>

<p>Permanent requirements have to do with the presence of facilities on the bicycle. The bicycle must always have the described facilities. Although the government imposes requirements on the bicycle, bicycles and bicycle parts are still sold that do not meet these requirements. It therefore remains important to pay attention when purchasing bicycles and bicycle parts.</p>
   
    <p>The bicycle must be provided with:<br>
    A good working bell.<br>
    A good working brake.<br>
    A red reflector, which is provided with an approval mark.</p>

<p class="opmaaktextrules">This reflector must be fitted between the luggage carrier and the mudguard at a height of 35 centimeters to 90 centimeters above the road surface. If the mudguard is missing, the reflector may also be mounted under the saddle.</p>

<p class="opmaaktextrules">White or yellow reflectors on the wheels. The white or yellow reflectors must be mounted on both sides of the wheel as close as possible to the rim. Most bicycle tires have a reflection stripe on the tire, so that the cyclist is also clearly visible in the dark. The quality of this is not always good and declines during use. So pay attention to this.</p>

<p class="opmaaktextrules">Four amber or yellow reflectors on the pedals. The trappers sold in the Netherlands are practically all standard equipped with these reflectors.</p>

<p class="opmaaktextrules">The obligation to have a bright white or reflective yellow rear mudguard has expired. But for extra visibility such a mudguard of course no harm. Just like a white front reflector or reflective elements on the clothing.</p>

<p class="textoranje">Use requirements</p>

<p>The word says it all, usage requirements are obligations for the use of facilities in certain circumstances. The most important requirement is of course lighting. Bicycles that are used at night (between sunset and sunrise) or by day when visibility is poor, must be provided with:</p>

<p>A bright red shining clear visible rear light. Affixed to the rear of the bicycle, between 25 and 120 centimeters above the road surface. A clear white or yellow shining light for the oncoming traffic. The lighting does not have to be on the bike anymore, but can also be stuck on the cyclist's trunk.</p>

<p class="opmaaktextrules">There are all kinds of bicycle lights for sale. Loose lights are very useful for people who have to put their bicycle in cramped garages, for example. Compact lights with batteries with LED lights last a long time. They must be permanently on, indicators are not allowed. TestKees regularly tests the quality of the different types and brands of bicycle lighting.</p>

 <section id="menu4">
    <a href="#menu4">04_Bike path for cyclists <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p>Motorists are not allowed to drive or stop at a bike path. They are not allowed to park or stand still on a bicycle lane (broken or uninterrupted line and bicycle symbol). However, cars are allowed to drive along a cycle path with a dashed line to, for example, turn off or drive to a parking space.</p>
</section>  
 
 <section id="menu5">
    <a href="#menu5">05_Child on the back <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p>Children under eight years of age may only be in the back of a seat.</p>
</section> 

  
<section id="menu6">
    <a href="#menu6">06_Maximum width <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p>A bicycle can be up to 75 centimeters wide. Wider bicycles, such as old-fashioned carrier bicycles, are up to 150 centimeters wide and use the roadway.</p>
</section> 
  
<section id="menu7">
    <a href="#menu7">07_Cycling side by side <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p>Cyclists are allowed to ride next to each other in pairs. Just like car passengers, who sit next to each other, cyclists find it pleasant to drive next to each other. They must not, however, cause hindrance.</p>
</section> 
  
<section id="menu8">
    <a href="#menu8">08_Parking <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p>Bicycles are parked on the pavement, on the footpath or on the roadside or in other places designated by the competent authority.</p>
</section> 
  
<section id="menu9">
    <a href="#menu9">09_Place on the road <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p class="opmaaktextrules">Cyclists, like other drivers, should keep to the right as much as possible. Cyclists are allowed to overtake stationary and moving fast traffic on the right and left.</p>

<p>Cyclists may take off the bicycle lane with a broken line if necessary. This is not allowed with a continuous line. Unfortunately, that is occasionally necessary if the cycle path is blocked by a stationary or incorrectly parked car. Always look back first and clearly state what you are planning, in relation to traffic behind.</p>
</section> 
  
<section id="menu10">
    <a href="#menu10">10_turn right on red light <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p class="opmaaktextrules">
Cyclists are allowed to drive right through red or orange when the text is on a sign at the traffic light: 'Turn right for cyclists free' or 'Turn right for cyclists and cyclists'. They must give priority to crossing traffic, often pedestrians. Motorists must give cyclists the space to be able to sort on the right.</p>

<p>The Fietsersbond believes that right through red should always be allowed. It can almost always be without dangers and who wants cyclists to follow the traffic rules better, can better legalize situations in which it is very tempting to drive red.</p>
</section> 
  
<section id="menu11">
    <a href="#menu11">11_indicate direction <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p>Cyclists must indicate direction if they change direction. You can do that by hand, but you can also use orange flashing lights. Road users, including cyclists, must stop for pedestrians who are about to cross the zebra crossing.</p>
