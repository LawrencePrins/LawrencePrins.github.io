    <a href="#menu1">01_Priority roads <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p>The priority road is indicated by shark teeth and / or by priority signs. Drivers from side roads must give priority to all drivers on the priority road. In the case of an exit construction, often in the form of a continuous curb, priority must be given to all traffic, including pedestrians.

    <a href="#menu2">02_Right priority <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p class="opmaaktextrules">
At equivalent crossings, all drivers coming from the left must give priority to drivers coming from the right. An equivalent crossing is an intersection where the priority is not regulated by special measures (traffic lights, signs, shark teeth). Drivers are drivers, motorcyclists, mopeds, cyclists, coachmen, riders and companion animals. So basically all road users except pedestrians, skaters and rollerbladers. So clear, but it is important to pay attention, to be clearly visible and to seek eye contact in case of doubt. The following exceptions apply to this scheme:</p>

<p>Drivers on a dirt road give priority to drivers on a paved road;<br>
Drivers grant priority to drivers of a tram;<br>
An exit or exit construction, often a continuous curb, always means giving priority, even to pedestrians.</p>

<section id="menu3">
    <a href="#menu3">03_Roundabouts <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow down" class="popdown"></a>
    <p class="opmaaktextrules">The rules, exceptions and design on roundabouts can differ per municipality. The applicable rules are indicated with signs and especially shark teeth. For cyclists it is advisable to always pay close attention to the shark teeth. Traffic that runs at the roundabout, in principle, has priority over traffic that approaches or leaves the roundabout. Straight ahead on the same road. The cyclist has no priority on roundabouts outside the built-up area. A cyclist who follows the roundabout must give priority to turning off car traffic.</p>

    <p>Within the built-up area, the cyclist usually takes precedence over the car traffic at the roundabout. Some road authorities consider that the priority for cyclists is too dangerous and deviate from the official guideline to give cyclists in built-up areas priority on roundabouts. It is therefore advisable to pay close attention to the prevailing priority rules at roundabouts. Pay attention to the shark teeth and the priority signs.</p>

    <p>In addition, it is certainly important at and on roundabouts to indicate direction (also mandatory) and to seek eye contact. Show what you are planning.</p>

    <p>In residential areas, as elsewhere, you are obliged to give priority to all drivers of the right.</p>
